# React App with Webpack, Babel, and TypeScript

This React app is built from scratch using Webpack and Babel in a TypeScript environment. It serves as a learning resource to understand how to build and bundle React applications, both with and without code splitting.

`npm run build` This will create the bundled JavaScript file and other files as code splitted using Webpack and Babel in the dist folder.
